# hello-world
Just another repository

Hello everyone,

I'm trying to get used to Anaconda-Navigator so that I can use builds to read Illumina data and my research has brought me to this site. Hopefully somoeone out there can help me or I can find out more information involving enviorment builds and future analysis of my sequence data.
